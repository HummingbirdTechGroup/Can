## Why

Imagine I give you this data:

```
$data = [
	'key1' => 123,
	'key2' => 'abc',
	'key3' => true
];
```

And then I ask you to validate it according to the following constraints:

- It must be an array.
- `key1` must contain an integer between `100` and `200`.
- `key2` must contain a non-empty string.
- `key3` must contain either a boolean or a callable.
- If `key4` is set, it must be an array with a maximum of `3` items.
- It cannot have any other key.

How long would your code to validate `$data` be?

Using this project, it can be validated with this code:

```
can($data)->claim(To::beArray()
    ->withKey('key1')->expected(To::beInteger()->withMin(100)->withMax(200))
    ->withKey('key2')->expected(To::beString()->withMinLength(1))
    ->withKey('key3')->expected(To::beOneOf(To::beBoolean(), To::beCallable()))
    ->withKey('key4')->expected(To::beOptionalAnd(To::beArray()->withMaxCount(3)))
    ->withNoOtherKeys()
);
```

## Install

Open a command console, enter your project directory and execute the
following command to download the latest stable version of this project:

```bash
$ composer require carlosv2/can
```

This command requires you to have Composer installed globally, as explained
in the [installation chapter](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)
of the Composer documentation.
